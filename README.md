# Design Patterns in Java

Welcome to the Design Patterns in Java repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for developers looking to understand and apply software design patterns in their Java projects. Design patterns are proven solutions to recurring software design problems, offering reusable and efficient approaches to code organization and structure.

## Introduction to Design Patterns

Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems that have been proven effective over time. They provide a way to address specific design challenges and improve the overall architecture and maintainability of a software system. By understanding and applying design patterns, developers can create more flexible, extensible, and robust applications.

In this repository, we explore a variety of design patterns categorized into three main types: creational patterns, structural patterns, and behavioral patterns. Each pattern has its own purpose and can be used to solve specific design problems. By studying these patterns and their implementations in Java, you'll gain a deeper understanding of software design principles and be able to apply them to your own projects.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Design Patterns in Java repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Jitesh-Raghav/design-patterns-java.git
   ```

2. Open the repository in your preferred Java development environment, such as IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.

3. Navigate to the specific design pattern you want to explore. Each pattern is organized into its own directory, containing relevant Java classes and code examples.

4. Study the pattern's description, purpose, and usage scenarios provided in the README file within the pattern's directory.

5. Examine the code examples and understand how the pattern is implemented in Java. Run the examples to see the pattern in action and observe the expected output.

6. Experiment with the code, modify it, and integrate the patterns into your own projects to gain hands-on experience and better grasp the concepts.

## Pattern Categories

The design patterns in this repository are categorized into the following types:

1. Creational Patterns: These patterns focus on object creation mechanisms, providing flexible ways to create objects while decoupling the client code from specific classes. Examples include Singleton, Factory Method, Abstract Factory, and Builder patterns.

2. Structural Patterns: These patterns deal with the composition of classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionalities. Examples include Adapter, Composite, Decorator, and Proxy patterns.

3. Behavioral Patterns: These patterns address the interaction between objects and the assignment of responsibilities among them. They assist in implementing communication and collaboration between objects effectively. Examples include Observer, Strategy, Template Method, and Command patterns.

## Pattern Examples

Within each pattern directory, you'll find the following:

- README.md: Provides an overview of the pattern, its purpose, and usage scenarios.
- Code Examples: Java classes that demonstrate the implementation of the pattern.
- UML Diagrams: Visual representations of the pattern's structure and relationships.
- References: Additional resources and recommended readings for further exploration.

Feel free to explore and study the provided examples for each pattern. Gain a deeper understanding of their application, and adapt them to your own projects to solve specific design challenges effectively.

## Contributing

Contributions to this repository are welcome! If you have any improvements, additional design patterns, or code examples to share, please follow the standard GitHub contribution workflow:

1. Fork the repository to your GitHub account.
2. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b my-feature`
3. Commit your changes with descriptive commit messages: `git commit -m "Add new design pattern example"`
4. Push your branch to your forked repository: `git push origin my-feature`
5. Submit a pull request to the main repository. Provide a clear description of your changes and the motivation behind them.
